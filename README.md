# ESP_CourseProject_MicroclimateSystem
Repository for implementation of microclimate system for Raspberry Pi device

In the process of development PyCharm Professional, Python, Raspberry Pi and sensors (MQ-135, DHT11) were used.

This software-hardware system allows us to get measurements from temperature and humidity sensors according to entered interval.
Furthermore, if CO concentration is higher than some value, you can hear specific sound alarm.

This project is a base idea for further DiplomaProject.
